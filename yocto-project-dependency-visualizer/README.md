#  Basic instructions

Visualization can only be generated for workspaces containing folder "build" in the root directory with file "task-depends.dot" (can be generated by BitBake). The folder for which the visualization should be generated has to be the only one in the workspace or it has to be the first folder of the workspace.

You can select nodes in the visualization by clicking on the boxes outside of the text label with the name of the recipe. Only one visualization at a time can be generated. User can select for which BitBake task the visualization will be generated. "DEFAULT" value means do_prepare_recipe_sysroot on the left side of the dependency in  the "task-depends.dot" and do_populate_sysroot on the right side.
