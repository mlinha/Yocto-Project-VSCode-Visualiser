# Yocto Project VSCode Visualiser

An Visual Studio Code extension development. The developed extension can be used to  Visualize  dependencies of recipes in the Yocto Project environment.

# Implemented features

1. Load bitbake generated task-depends.dot file and parse it (currently only connections with the following format are parsed: *"x.do_prepare_recipe_sysroot" -> "y.do_populate_sysroot"*).
2. Use parsed data to create a node-link diagram.
3. Basic interactivity in the displayed diagram:
  - pan and zoom
  - remove unwanted nodes
 
# Future work

- implement ability to create task-depends.dot file from the extension and then load it
- posibillity to return removed nodes back to the graph
- graph layout options

# How to use

The extension is still in the development so it can only be used by cloning this repository, running the '''npm run watch''' command and then pressing the F5 button (note: all tools needed for VSCode extension development are required, for more information follow this [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension).

Once the testing VSCode window is open, press *Ctrl+Shift+P* and select the *Yocto Project Dependency Visualizer:Generate visualization* command which should open a new tab with the visualization (note: the task-depends.dot file has to be generated by BitBake).
